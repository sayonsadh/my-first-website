                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
